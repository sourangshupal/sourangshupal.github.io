## Welcome!

I'm excited to launch this blog where I'll be sharing insights about AI, machine learning, and practical applications of modern AI systems.

## What You Can Expect

As a Senior AI Consultant, I work daily with:

- Multi-agent systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures
- Vector databases and semantic search
- LLM applications and frameworks

I'll be sharing tutorials, best practices, and real-world examples from my work.

## Quick Demo: Simple Python Code

Let's start with a simple example to show how code works in these posts:
```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Welcome to My Blog!')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('sin(X)')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

## Coming Soon

I'm planning posts on:

- Building production RAG systems
- Vector database comparisons
- LangChain vs LlamaIndex
- Multi-modal AI applications

Stay tuned!
